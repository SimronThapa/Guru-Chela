			"Equation: Equations describe the relations between the dependent and independent variables. An equal sign '=' is required in every equation.",
			"Differential Equation: Equations that involve dependent variables and their derivatives with respect to the independent variables are called differential equations.",
			"Ordinary Differential Equation: Differential equations that involve only ONE independent variable are called ordinary differential equations.",
			"Partial Differential Equation: Differential equations that involve two or more independent variables are called partial differential equations.",
			"Order: The order of a differential equation is the highest derivative that appears in the differential equation.",
			"Degree: The degree of a differential equation is the power of the highest derivative term.",
			"Linear: A differential equation is called linear if there are no multiplications among dependent variables and their derivatives. In other words, all coefficients are functions of independent variables.",
			"Non-linear: Differential equations that do not satisfy the definition of linear are non-linear.",
			"Homogeneous: A differential equation is homogeneous if every single term contains the dependent variables or their derivatives.",
			"Non-homogeneous: Differential equations which do not satisfy the definition of homogeneous are considered to be non-homogeneous.",
			"General Solution: Solutions obtained from integrating the differential equations are called general solutions. The general solution of a nth order ordinary differential equation contains n arbitrary constants resulting from integrating n times.",
			"Particular Solution: Particular solutions are the solutions obtained by assigning specific values to the arbitrary constants in the general solutions.",
			"Singular Solutions: Solutions that can not be expressed by the general solutions are called singular solutions.",
			"Initial Condition: Constrains that are specified at the initial point, generally time point, are called initial conditions. Problems with specified initial conditions are called initial value problems.",
			"Boundary Condition: Constrains that are specified at the boundary points, generally space points, are called boundary conditions. Problems with specified boundary conditions are called boundary value problems.",
