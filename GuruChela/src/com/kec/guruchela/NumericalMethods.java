If the bisection method results in a computer program that runs too slow, then other faster methods may be chosen; otherwise it is a good choice of method.",

	       "The Secant Method is second best to Newton’s Method, and is used when a faster convergence than Bisection is desired, but it is too difficult or impossible to take an analytical derivative of the function f(x).",
