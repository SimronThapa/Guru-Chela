			"Engineering is composed of Physical and Economic components.",
			"Physical Environment : Engineers produce products and services depending on physical laws (e.g. Ohm's law; Newton's law)."
					+ " Physical efficiency takes the form:"
					+ " Physical (effecicncy)= system output/system input",
			"Economic Environment : Much less of a quantitative nature is known about economic environments -- this is due to economics being involved with the actions of people, and the structure of organizations."
					+ "Following are some examples where engineering economy plays a crucial role:"
					+ "1. Choosing the best design for a high-efficiency gas furnace"
					+ "2.Selecting the most suitable robot for a welding operation on an automotive assembly line"
					+ "3.Making a recommendation about whether jet airplanes for an overnight delivery service should be purchased or leased"
					+ "4.Considering the choice between reusable and disposable bottles for high-demand beverages",
			"ENGINEERING ECONOMIC STUDIES:",
			"Creative Step : People with vision and initiative adopt the premise that better opportunities exist than are known to them. This leads to research, exploration, and investigation of potential opportunities.",
			"Definition Step : System alternatives are synthesised with economic requirements and physical requirements, and enumerated with respect to inputs/outputs.",
			"Conversion Step : The attributes of system alternatives are converted to a common measure so that systems can be compared.",
			"Decision Step : Qualitative and quantitative inputs and outputs to/from each system form the basis for system comparison and decision making. Decisions among system alternatives should be made on the basis of their differences. For a small number of real world systems there will be complete knowledge. All facts/information and their relationships, judgements and predictive behavior become a certainty. For most systems, however, even after all of the data that can be bought to bear on it has been considered, some areas of uncertainty are likely to remain. If a decision must be made, these areas of uncertainty must be bridged by consideration of non-quantitative data/information, such as common sense, judgement and so forth.",
			"Examples :" +

			"1.Infrastructure expenditure decision"
					+ "2.Replace versus repair decisions"
					+ "3.Selection of inspection method"
					+ "4.Selection of a replacement for an equipment",
			"FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC CONCEPTS:",
			"Utility is the power of a good or service to satisfy human needs.",
			"Value:"
					+

					"Designates the worth that a person attaches to an object or service. "
					+ "Is a measure or appraisal of utility in some medium of exchange. "
					+ "Is not the same as cost or price. ",
			"Consumer goods : Consumer goods are the goods and services that directly satisfy human wants. For example, TV, shoes, houses."
					+ "Producer goods : Producer goods are the goods and services that satisfy human wants indirectly as a part of the production or construction process. For example, factory equipment, industrial chemicals ands materials.",
			"CLASSIFICATION OF COST:",
			"First (or Initial) Cost : Cost to get activity started such as property improvement, transportation, installation, and initial expenditures",
			"Operation and Maintenance Cost : They are experienced continually over the usefull life of the activity.",

			"Fixed Cost : Fixed costs arise from making preparations for the future, and includes costs associated with ongoing activities throughout the operational life-time of that concern. Fixed costs are relatively constant; they are decoupled from the system input/output, for example.",
			"Variable Cost : Variable costs are related to the level of operational activity (e.g. the cost of fuel for construction equipment will be a function of the number of days of use).",
			"Incremental or Marginal Cost : Incremental (or marginal) cost is the additional expense that will be incurred from increased output in one or more system units (i.e. production increase). It is determined from the variable cost.",
			"Sunk Cost : It cannot be recovered or altered by future actions. Usually this cost is not a part of engineering economic analysis.",
			"Life-Cycle Cost : This is cost for the entire life-cycle of a product, and includes feasibility, design, construction, operation and disposal costs.",
